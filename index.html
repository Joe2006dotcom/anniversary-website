  <h1>Happy 3rd Month Anniversary to Both of Us ❤️</h1>

  <p>
    My love,<br><br>
    Three moons have passed since our hearts first intertwined,<br>
    Three chapters written in this story of you and I.<br>
    Each sunrise paints your name upon my soul,<br>
    Each nightfall wraps me in the warmth of your love.<br><br>

    In your eyes, I’ve found the spark of every dream,<br>
    In your words, the melody that calms my restless mind.<br>
    You’ve turned ordinary days into precious memories,<br>
    Moments with you feel like eternity wrapped in seconds.<br><br>

    Your laughter dances in my thoughts like morning light,<br>
    Your smile lingers like the sweetest song on my lips.<br>
    Every message, every call, every heartbeat shared—<br>
    They’ve stitched a tapestry of love that grows ever stronger.<br><br>

    Three months may seem brief to the world outside,<br>
    But to me, they hold a lifetime of reasons to love you.<br>
    I promise, my dearest, to hold your heart with gentle hands,<br>
    To cherish you fiercely, in calm and storm alike.<br><br>

    As we celebrate this day, know this with all your heart—<br>
    You are my muse, my miracle, my endless forever.<br>
    Happy 3rd Month Anniversary, my love.<br>
    I adore you more deeply than words can ever tell.
  </p>
